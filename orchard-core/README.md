# orchard-core-react

## Why?

Orchard Core is a great CMS, but it's built on ASP.NET Core backend and Razor Pages frontend. This is great for .NET developers, but not so great for frontend developers. This project aims to provide a React front-end for Orchard Core. The idea is to use orchard-core as a headless CMS and use React to build the front end.

## Status

This project is in the early stages of development. It is not ready for production use. It is not feature-complete.
